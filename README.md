# Brian M's Learning Platform

This repository hosts a collection of small React experiments and mini‑games. The app acts as a personal playground where different ideas are prototyped using React, React Router and Tailwind CSS. Each feature is accessible from the navigation bar and can be explored individually.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your Firebase credentials if you want to enable Firebase features.
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. To create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Run the test suite (requires dependencies to be installed):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Features

- **Snack Trail** – A light‑hearted, snack‑themed take on the classic Oregon Trail. Manage your crew and snacks while random events push you toward the goal.
- **Pixel Lab** – A 16×16 pixel art maker complete with color palette, brush and eraser tools, and a private gallery saved to local storage.
- **Robot Room** – Assemble robots from hundreds of randomly generated parts. Each robot has unique stats that change as you swap components.
- **Build Mode** – A simple LEGO building interface where you place pieces, choose colors and follow small build instructions.
- **Inventory** – Search and filter a sample LEGO inventory to keep track of your pieces.
- **Alchemy** – Mix and match elements in a playful Little Alchemy‑style puzzle.
- **The Matrix** – Enter your name, pick a pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes. Includes a boot transition, terminal challenge and small puzzle.
- **Matrix Portal** – A portal page (work in progress) intended for future connectivity between Matrix features.

Enjoy exploring the different experiments contained in this project!
